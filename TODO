code coverage (requires xdebug... ugg....): vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage

[ ] hash code and save each generated character so that they can be retrieved later; tie to an account

[ ] give user choice points like class of hero, high or low rolls (roller then will scale up/down on rolls), max/min rolls
	[ ] when they make something "sticky" that then remembers the roll for that item and when it rerolls, if that roll was "sticky" then it rolls that again
	[ ] will need to remember rolls and tie them to sticky locations
[ ] crazy or not
[ ] ben: let them "stick" decisions of the results. like keep the bionics stuck, but change out the abilities. or keep strenght the same but redo the rest. this could be really tricky? or just make the classes sticky? how to make bonuses come and go based on sticky?
