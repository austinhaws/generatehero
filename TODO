[ ] hash code and save each generated character so that they can be retrieved later

[ ] give user choice points like class of hero, high or low rolls (roller then will scale up/down on rolls), max/min rolls
[ ] crazy or not
[ ] what other choices can they make?
[ ] ben: let them "stick" decisions of the results. like keep the bionics stuck, but change out the abilities. or keep strenght the same but redo the rest. this could be really tricky? or just make the classes sticky? how to make bonuses come and go based on sticky?

skills all ahve a base %; do the "Bonus::SET" base percentages BEFORE adding bonuses to character
review skills to see if they add anything to character
WP Skills are either on or off, don't add percentages for them


ben, "I like the idea of the hero generator.  One thing that would be helpful for these character generators is the ability to lock different sections so they stay the same while re-rolling other stuff."

TO DO
[ ] alien powers : pg 56 (step four, super powers)
[ ] total bonuses at end of character creation
	[ ] do skill "set" first to get highets possible starting value for a skill
	[ ] do adds for bonuses

[ ] find TODOs
